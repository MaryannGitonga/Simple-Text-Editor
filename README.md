# Simple-Text-Editor
A simple Java Text Editor made using Java Swing.

## Motivation
I want to make a text editor that implements data structures (sepcifically stacks and linked lists) and so for starters, I thought of building something similar but simpler to get a gist of the general functionalities. And also for fun:)

## Functionalities
+ Can open a file using FileReader and BufferedReader classes
+ Can save text to new file using FileWriter and BufferedWriter classes
+ Can copy, cut, paste and print using the JTextArea class methods

## Technologies Used
+ Java Swing

## Improvements
A text editor that uses stacks and linked lists to perform Insert, Delete, Save and Undo operations.
